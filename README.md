# Seven Line Search Engine
This project demonstrates how to write a fast document search engine using pandas, NLTK and a simple Python dictionary.

Not including data cleaning or import statements, it consists of six lines of code to index the document (in this case, all of Shakespeare). After that, the code to search the index is a one line function.

The code is demonstrated in the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/jeremyadamsfisher/7-line-search-engine/blob/master/Searchspeare.ipynb) above.
